 *
 * Command-side limiting. This node never sends torque: it sends an MIT command
 * {q_des, dq_des, kp, kd, tau_ff} and the motor (or the sim's motor model) turns that into
 *
 *     tau = tau_ff + kp * (q_des - q) + kd * (dq_des - dq)
 *
 * So "limit the torque" has to be expressed on the command, using the measured q/dq we already have
 * from /motor_state. Four rules, applied per joint, in this order (each one is the cheapest way to
 * bound the quantity the rule before it could not):
 *
 *   1. gains:      kp <= kp_max, kd <= kd_max (and >= 0)
 *   2. dq_des:     clamped to +/- dq_max
 *   3. slew:       |q_des - q_des_prev| <= slew * dt          (bounds how fast the implied torque can grow)
 *   4. torque:     the *implied* torque at the measured state must satisfy |tau| <= tau_limit, so the
 *                  position error is budgeted: kp*|q_des - q| <= tau_limit - |tau_ff| - kd*|dq_des - dq|
 *
 * What this does and does not guarantee (be honest about it):
 *   * guaranteed: the torque implied by the command *at the measured state* is within tau_limit - that
 *     is exactly the quantity a driver would compute one control cycle later;
 *   * not guaranteed: what happens if the joint lags behind and the error grows - that is bounded by
 *     rule 3 (the error can only grow as fast as `slew`) and by kp, i.e. the torque can overshoot the
 *     limit by roughly kp * slew * dt per cycle until the next command arrives. With the defaults
 *     (kp = 40, slew = 20 rad/s, dt = 5 ms) that is 4 N.m per cycle - worth knowing, and the reason
 *     `slew` should not be raised carelessly.
 *
 * See @20261007_assignment/docs/safety-limits.md section 3 (implementation, calibration) and
 * section 5 (what is still missing), plus docs/porting.md section 2.
